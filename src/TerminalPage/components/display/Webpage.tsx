                I built this site to serve as both a portfolio and a personal playground of sorts; a place to showcase
                my work and also share things related to my own hobbies and interests. It also updates my old website so
                that it can easily grow or change if I need it to.

                I decided to model the UI after a vintage terminal — not just because I enjoy the retro aesthetic, but
                also because I’m fascinated by older technology because of the constraints of that era that often
                required a great deal of creativity to overcome.
