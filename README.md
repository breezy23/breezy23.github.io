# breezy23.github.io

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — built to showcase my work, reflect my personality, and grow alongside my skillset.  
The UI is inspired by vintage terminal interfaces, blending a retro aesthetic with a modern tech stack.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as:
- A personal **portfolio** to present my background, skills, and experience
- A **personal hub** for hobbies, experiments, and web-hosted content
- A learning opportunity to explore **modern web frameworks** and **UI/UX design**

## 🧠 Design Inspiration

The interface takes inspiration from vintage terminals — partly because I like the retro aesthetic, but also because 
I’m drawn to older technology. Working around tight limitations often led to clever, creative solutions, 
which is a mindset I try to bring to my own work.
